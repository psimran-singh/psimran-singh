Hello friends! My name is Simran.
Welcome to my GitHub page.

Here you'll find some of my work. Please be patient as I add some of my offline work onto here. I have lots to share, including geospatial data manipulation and some cool machine learning projects.

Please check out my NJ Solar Adoption Dashboard over here (hoping to update this soon with some new data and features):
