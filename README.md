Hello friends! Welcome to my GitHub page.

My name is Simran (short for Prabhsimran).

I am an aspiring data science professional (or maybe academic? who knows....)

I am most experienced in statistical analysis using R, but I have experience in Python, Stata, and SAS as well.
I also have some professional experience with SQL from my time as a data analyst working in financial services.

I left my job in financial services because I felt my skills could be better utilized for important tasks, beyond just making banks wealthier.
My goal now is to continue to develop my skills as a data scientist and communicator, specifically in civic fields.
I hope that I can, in one way or another, use data science and my knowledge of it to contribute to helping the planet and the people that live here.
