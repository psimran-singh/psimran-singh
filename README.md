Hello friends! Welcome to my GitHub page.

My name is Simran.

I am an aspiring data science professional (or maybe academic? who knows....)

I am most experienced in statistical analysis using R, but I have experience in Python, Stata, and SAS as well.
I also have some professional experience with SQL from my time as a data analyst working in financial services.

I left my job in financial services because I felt my skills could be better utilized in fields I'm passionate about (my passion for credit cards and banking is extremely scarce).
My goal now is to continue to develop my skills as a data scientist and data communicator, specifically on topics like renewable energy.
I currently work for the Center for Green Building at Rutgers as a graduate assistant. We are working on a project looking to calculate the technical and economic potential of solar energy in New Jersey.
I hope that I can, in one way or another, use data science and my knowledge of it to contribute to helping the planet and the people that live here.
